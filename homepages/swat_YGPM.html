    <h1>Systematic Yeast Library</h1>
    <p>
    The data displayed was obtained from Jones et al. (submitted for publication), describing the construction of a systematic library of the <em>S.cerevisiae</em> genome in a high copy number vector. The complete library collection contains 5179 plasmids with inserts that average 9.6 kb, and a minimal pathway through the genome that was derived from the complete collection contains 1588 plasmids, with average inserts of 10.8 kb. The September 2007 version of the library covers ~97% of the <em>S. cerevisiae</em> genome.

    Clones in the minimal tiling set are shown as a white box with a red border and clones in the supplementary set are shown as a yellow box with a blue border.
