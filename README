Bio-Das-ProServer
=================

Bio::Das::ProServer is an implementation of the BioDAS protocol, http://biodas.org/
for the serving of biological data using XML over HTTP.

Bio::Das::ProServer is designed as a lightweight alternative to some other
DAS servers. Version 2.0 is a drop-in replacement for previous versions but
has a core based on the POE system which is much better tested and debugged
than the ProServer v1 core. ProServer can be seen as the server-side complement
to the Bio-DasLite client.
